## Nebula Dev Edition
 Nebula Dev Edition is a testing branch of the Nebula. 
 **I highly recommend you not to use this as it is in its earliest days of development.**

 ## What changed?
 - Nebulas file structure was messy and unorganized and hard to find specific code for certain elements. So the biggest changed will be its file structure. 

 - I tried going for the Slate file structure, I assume it brings some optimization. 

 **In conclusion the only things changing will be the file structure and performance.**
