```
git clone https://github.com/Euphorianic/Nebula
```

Since Powercord's updater is currently broken, you have to update the theme manually. In order to do this, **Open your CMD / Powershell / Terminal / Gitbash, CD into the Nebula folder, and enter the following:**
```
git pull
```
If you've found any bugs, and issues with this theme, please DM my discord.
