## Installation

**To install this theme, if you don't have the Theme Downloader Plugin, cd into your Powercord themes folder using your Terminal, Command prompt, or Git Bash. Then copy and paste the text below:**

```
git clone https://github.com/Euphorianic/Nebula
```
## Updating

**Since Powercord's updater is currently broken, you have to update the theme manually. In order to do this, Open your CMD / Powershell / Terminal / Gitbash, CD into the Nebula folder, and enter the following:**
```
git pull
```
**If you've found any bugs, and issues with this theme, please DM my discord.**

## Credits

**Thank you SlippityGitty(Vozy) for testing this theme and finding bugs!**

**Thank you LuckFire for allowing me to use your themes.**

## Bugs

- **The floating bars will go back up, then down to their modified position when leaving the settings tab.**

- **For some users, the animated picture for servers, will have a smaller width.**

## Disclaim

**Please refrain from making changes to this theme yourself unless you know 100% what you're doing. The code in this theme is really messy and unorganized. Multiple element positions and size depend on other elements. Please ask me if you'd like to change anything at all to this theme and you're not sure how to do it.**

*Original Concept from TMdesign*
